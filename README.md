# Pavilion

Pavilion is a Python 3 (3.4+) based framework for running and analyzing 
tests targeting HPC systems. It provides a rich YAML-based configuration 
system for wrapping test codes and running them against various systems.
The vast majority of the system is defined via plugins,, giving users the 
ability to extend and modify Pavilion's operation to suit their needs. 
Plugin components include those for gathering system data, adding 
additional schedulers, parsing test results, and more.
